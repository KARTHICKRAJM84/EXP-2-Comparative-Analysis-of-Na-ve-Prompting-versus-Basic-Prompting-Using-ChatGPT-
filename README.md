# Aim:
 To test how ChatGPT responds to naïve prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic 
prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios, analyzing the quality, accuracy, 
and depth of the generated responses.
# Instructions:
1. Define the Two Prompt Types:
o Naïve Prompts: Broad, vague, or open-ended prompts with little specificity.
o Basic Prompts: Clear, detailed, and structured prompts that give specific instructions 
or context to guide the model.
2. Prepare Multiple Test Scenarios:
o Select various scenarios such as:
 Generating a creative story.
 Answering a factual question.
 Summarizing an article or concept.
 Providing advice or recommendations.
 Or Any other test scenario
o For each scenario, create both a naïve and a basic prompt. Ensure each pair of 
prompts targets the same task but with different levels of structure.
3. Run Experiments with ChatGPT:
o Input the naïve prompt for each scenario and record the generated response.
o Then input the corresponding basic prompt and capture that response.
o Repeat this process for all selected scenarios to gather a full set of results.
4. Evaluate Responses :
Compare how ChatGPT performs when given naïve versus basic prompts and analyze the 
output based on Quality,Accuracy and Depth. Also analyse does ChatGPT consistently provide better 
results with basic prompts? Are there scenarios where naïve prompts work equally well?

STEP BY STEP PATTERN:
Prompt: Now imagine you are a master chef, give a step by step process of making biriyani, also the 
paragraph should contain only 250 words
Result: As a master chef, here's how to make a flavorful biryani:
Step 1: Marinate the Meat
In a large bowl, combine chicken or mutton with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, chili powder, turmeric, 
garam masala, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to absorb the spices.
Step 2: Prepare the Rice
Rinse basmati rice thoroughly, then soak it for 30 minutes. Boil water with whole spices (bay leaves, 
cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom). Add the rice and cook until it's 70% done. Drain and set aside.
Step 3: Fry the Onions
Heat oil or ghee in a deep pot. Fry thinly sliced onions until golden brown and crispy. Remove and set 
aside for garnish.
Step 4: Cook the Meat
In the same pot, add the marinated meat. Cook on medium heat until the meat is tender and the 
spices are well combined. Add chopped tomatoes, fresh mint, and coriander leaves.
Step 5: Layering
In a heavy-bottomed pot, layer half the cooked rice over the meat. Sprinkle fried onions, mint, and 
coriander. Add another layer of rice, more fried onions, and saffron-infused milk or food coloring.
Step 6: Dum Cooking
Cover the pot tightly and cook on low heat for 20–30 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend. 
Step 7: Serve
Fluff up the rice, garnish with more onions and herbs, and serve hot with raita.
Enjoy your rich, aromatic biryani
